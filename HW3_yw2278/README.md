## Assignment 1</br>
Finding distribution for binomial, gaussian, lognormal, and poisson function, and using central limit theory to explain the result.
## Assignment 2</br>
Idea is poeple tend not to go out by bike on weekends. To prove that: </br>  
Form __null hypothesis__: </br>
average bike time per day in weekend is no less than that in weekdays</br>
and by using __z-test__ I get the value __-6.33__ thus we can reject to null hypothesis.
## Assignment 3</br>
Basically, the same as assignment 2, forming null hypothesis, using z-test to reject it and then accept the idea.
