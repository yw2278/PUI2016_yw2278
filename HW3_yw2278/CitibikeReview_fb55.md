I dont understand how the hypotheses follow from the question (there may be a lost in translation)

You are saying people are less or more likely to 'go out by bike' so that would naturally require a measure of how many people get a bike, but then you measure the trip duration instead. Do you mean more or less likely to go on long rides, like ricreational rides instead of commuting or something along those lines? But I would have guessed the opposite

The trip duration cannot informe on how likely one is to use the bike. Since that is your question, please stick with it and correct the hypothesis by looking at number of rides, instead of trip duration.

Also:
 I HAD  EXPLICTLY ASKED TO REMOVE THE TEST SO THAT YOUR REVIEWER COULD THINK OF IT BY THEMSELVES!

Data wrangling ok, and test of mean ok.
