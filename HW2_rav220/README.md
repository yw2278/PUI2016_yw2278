HW2

(Jonathan Pichot helped me with git issues,
how to call command from OS form within Python kernel in jupyter,
helped capture data from CUSP)
(helped Adrian Dahlon with csv i/o commands)
(helped Francis Ko with vi)

Assignment 1

- Created & Logged into MTA to get Key
- wrote script in linux environment (on compute) to:
    --- Test # of Args are correct
    --- Captured JSON file from API (with Key and bus line as arguments)
    --- Converted JSON data to PYTHON format
    --- Wrote data to a separate file and located relevant keys to use
    --- Wrote function to loop though relevant keys, outputting correspnding data accordingly
 - saved script, ran it with key and bus line as arguments
 - added, committed, pushed to git
  
Assignment 2
  
 - Contunied to use same key from MTA
 - wrote script in linux environment (on compute) to:
   --- Test # of Args are correct
   --- Captured JSON file from API (with Key, bus line and output csv file as arguements)
   --- Converted JSON data to PYTHON format
   --- Wrote data to a separate file and located relevant keys to use
   --- Wrote function to loop through relevant keys, outputting corresponding data to csv file (included condition to input N/As where no data exists)
- saved script, ran it with key, bus line and bus line csv as arguments
- added, committed, pushed to git (both scrpit file and csv)

Assignment 3
  
 - wrote script in jupyter environment (on compute) to:
   --- Captured data from CUSP (data with no less than 2 columns containing numbers)
   --- output few top rows
   --- Removed all columns except two with numbers, then output few top rows
   --- Graphed scatter plot
- added, committed, pushed to git (both scrpit file and csv)
