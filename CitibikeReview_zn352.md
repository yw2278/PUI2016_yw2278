## Citibike Review 
### Zhaohong Niu -> Richard Vecsler

### a. Verify formatting of Null and Alternative Hypotheses
The Null and Alternative Hypothesese are missing for now. 
According to data selected, I assume the Null Hypotheses would be: 
The amount of hours Customer bikers spend riding citibike in a week is the same of higher than amount of hours Subscripters spend riding citibike in a week. 

Alternative Hypotheses: The amount of hours Customer bikers spend riding citibike in a week is smaller than amount of hours Subscripters spend riding citibike in a week.

### b. Verify that the data supports the project
The data is approprate selected.

### c. Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked.
I recommend t-Test because it "looks at differences between two groups on some variable of interest". the IV is categorical, the DV is continuous.
