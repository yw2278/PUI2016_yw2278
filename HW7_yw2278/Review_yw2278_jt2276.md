# Reveiw of yw2278

![Plot from yw2278 notebook](https://github.com/jontoy/PUI2016_jt2276/blob/master/HW8_jt2276/yw2278_plot_image.png)

Peer Review:

The plot above describes the relationship between three generated random variables.
While the axes tell us that they are random variables, they do not make it clear which distributions they are pulling from.
The chosen color scheme and color bar succeed in making the 3rd dimension more easily understood.
The plot is honestly reproducing the user generated data without deformations.

The plot could be improved if a caption was included that explained the distributions of the variables and the major takeaway of the figure.

The interactive version of the plot can be found at http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jontoy/PUI2016_yw2278/blob/7eee1f113771d79c2aaf681a6f9bdd31b958ac9c/HW7_yw2278/Assignment_1.ipynb
