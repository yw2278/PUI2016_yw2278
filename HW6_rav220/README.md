HW 6

Assignment 1

The goal was to examine log-transformtion for potentialy better fit.  We compared these fits to the models derived from
undrlying nominal values accordingly.

Other than very adhoc work with others at CUSP, I had to work solo due to timing.  However, professor Frederica Bianco
gave some useful insight on how to manage issues related to datatype conversion, dataframe incompatability and machine-level
object encoding.

Some thoughts... In this case, we looked at the relationship between building energy consumption and numnber of building units.  In
the future, I would try features such as segment property type, age, class and perhaps height.  Given the dataset we are currently
working with for this problem set, if we're going to inlude units into our study, I would use residential buildings only
(multifamily in particular).  For commercial and retail, maybe just rentable area.  And for hotels, just keys.  Occcupancy info
(not just total units) would be phenomenal.

Assignment 2

Completed about half the assignment as it requires rewriting and some recoding.  None of it is submitted here,
but I wil continue working on it (it's worthwhile).
