HW 6

Assignment 1

The goal was to figure out when and how to transform our data and fit curvature.  We were assigned to determine how well energy expendenture predicts number of building units (and of course, vice versa).  After initial regression runs, we noticed a better chnace for a convincing fit by transforming our data into their log values.  We then compared fits to our models on the nominal values. We also tried adjusting our linear model to a polynomial one.  Professor Frederica Bianco gave some useful insight on how to manage issues related to datatype conversion, dataframe incompatability and machine-level object encoding.  Other then that, I went it alone on this one given timing nuances.

Assignment 2

Completed about half the assignment as it requires rewriting and some recoding.  None of it is submitted here,
but I wil continue working on it (it's worthwhile).
