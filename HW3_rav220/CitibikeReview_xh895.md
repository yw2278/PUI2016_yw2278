1.Hypothesis 
Lack of statement of idea, null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis clearly.
Didn't specify the significance level.

2. Data
   Data are clealy manipulated. 
   With how Richard dealt with data, I assumed that his idea was 'rides ratio taken by customer bikers during weekend is higher than weekdays'. 
   Data provided shows an overview of weekday data v.s. weekend data. So we can see an average ratio of customers rides during weekends and weekdays. 
   However, it hasn't shown the customer riders' ratios for weekend and weekdays for each week. We need to use that sample data in the analysis with sample size = number of weeks taken into account.
   Data manipulated shows a clear initail preference to either reject or accept null hypothesis.

3. Thus, Hypothesis is:
$H0: Cweekend/Aweekend - Cweekday/Aweekday <= 0$
$H1: Cweekend/Aweekend - Cweekday/Aweekday > 0$
significance leve 0.05

4. suggested statistical method: Z-test
